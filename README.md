# Trebol v0.4.0

Trebol is Clover's internal harness and the successor to the original
Swarm Go agent harness. It brings the Swarm development model
to Pi as an extension pack: structured prompt and
context assembly, policy and hooks, durable state, tasks, subagents, skills,
research tools, parity checks, and a Swarm-oriented terminal experience.

> **Status:** Active development. The repository is evolving quickly and some
> interfaces are still experimental.

## Why this repository exists

We spent a long time building and using these capabilities in the Swarm SDK.
That work gave us a mature set of ideas—agents, tools, skills, hooks, policy,
tasks, memory, and verification—but it also meant maintaining a separate agent
runtime and user experience.

We decided to move the integration to **Pi**. Pi already provides the provider
and agent loop, session management, native tools, and terminal UI. Trebol now
adds the Swarm capabilities as extensions instead of maintaining a second agent
runtime. This keeps the boundary clear:

```text
Pi owns the agent loop, provider, sessions, native tools, and TUI
        ↓
Trebol extensions add Swarm context, policy, tools, state, and UI
```

The migration adapts the Swarm model to Pi's lifecycle and extension APIs;
obsolete parity probes were retired in v0.4.0.

## Capabilities

### Runtime and context

- Swarm system-prompt and context assembly with provenance and bounded inputs
- Hierarchical `AGENTS.md` discovery
- Plan mode, thinking controls, prompt-context configuration, and inspection
- Session startup and rehydration through Pi lifecycle events
- Runtime hooks, transport parity, cache telemetry, and update checks

### Tools and orchestration

- Bash, filesystem, patch, image-reading, search, and research tools
- Subagents through `Agent` and `AgentControl`
- Task creation, planning, blocking, notes, status, and run control
- Schedules, goals, loops, and wakeups
- MCP and vault adapters
- CodeMode for confined, composable tool workflows
- User questions and structured annoyance/defect reporting

### State and memory

- Durable session entries and conversation metadata
- Repository, worktree, and global memory scopes
- Evidence-backed candidate capture/review, PageIndex discovery, and
  bounded read-only retrieval; a candidate is not an established fact
- Bounded history search and retrieval with redaction
- Shared state that does not depend on what the TUI happens to render

### Policy and presentation

- Capability, workspace, mutation, network, and approval policy; `/init`
  scaffolding can install a workspace structure guard
- Disk hooks and policy nudges
- Pi-native tool renderers plus Swarm hook rows and widgets
- Conversation metrics, footer segments, themes, control-panel status, and
  the `/btw` side-question overlay

### Verification

- Unit tests, integration tests, build checks, and dogfood commands
- Architecture notes documenting the migration and the important seams

## How it works

Pi loads extensions from `.pi/extensions/` one level deep. The numeric layer
prefixes define load order:

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `00-runtime` | Integration boundary, hooks, runtime, transport, telemetry |
| `10-context` | Prompt assembly, context, plan mode, skills, thinking |
| `20-policy` | Disk hooks and policy nudges |
| `30-tools` | Agents, tasks, bash, filesystem, search, MCP, research, vault, and more |
| `40-state` | Memory history and conversation metadata |
| `50-ui` | Metrics, themes, status, control panel, and UI extensions |

Each layer has a `package.json` whose `pi.extensions` list is authoritative.
An extension registers with Pi using `registerTool`, `registerCommand`,
`registerShortcut`, or lifecycle handlers such as `session_start`,
`before_agent_start`, `tool_call`, and `tool_result`.

The implementation is split between thin Pi adapters and reusable packages:

```text
.pi/extensions/       Pi entrypoints and registration
.pi/lib/              Shared runtime, context, tool, state, and UI helpers
packages/             Reusable TypeScript packages grouped by capability
docs/architecture/    Living design and migration notes
docs/reference/       Feature audits and validation notes
tests/                Repository-level tests
tools/                Integration runners, install checks, and maintenance
vendor/               Read-only upstream references and submodules
```

Semantic state, authorization, persistence, and cancellation belong to the
runtime or state layers—not to rendered transcript text. UI code presents
state; it must not become the source of truth for that state.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.pi/extensions/` | Pi extension entrypoints, grouped by load layer |
| `.pi/lib/` | Shared implementation used by extensions |
| `.pi/test/` | Tests for Pi-specific code |
| `.pi/config/` | Project prompt and Swarm settings; credentials stay ignored |
| `.pi/themes/` | Local Pi themes |
| `packages/runtime/` | Core identity, contracts, runtime control, and bootstrap |
| `packages/context/` | Prompt assets, skills, and generated-skill lifecycle |
| `packages/policy/` | Capability and execution policy |
| `packages/tools/` | Agents, CodeMode, MCP, scheduling, and task management |
| `docs/` | Architecture, plans, references, and parity documentation |
| `artifacts/` | Ignored probe output, recordings, and baselines |
| `vendor/` | Read-only upstream source and reference submodules |

The repository operating contract is [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Read it before
making changes; it describes extension inventory, capability ownership, safety
rules, and validation expectations.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js with npm workspaces support
- Git, including submodule support when working with vendored references
- Pi installed and available on your `PATH` for interactive use

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the runtime packages:

```bash
npm run build:runtime
```

Build all packages:

```bash
npm run build
```

Pi discovers the project extensions from the repository's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pi": {
    "extensions": [
      ".pi/extensions/00-runtime",
      ".pi/extensions/10-context",
      ".pi/extensions/20-policy",
      ".pi/extensions/30-tools",
      ".pi/extensions/40-state",
      ".pi/extensions/50-ui"
    ],
    "themes": [".pi/themes"]
  }
}
```

Start Pi from the repository root so the project extensions and hierarchical
context files are discovered:

```bash
pi
```

## Usage

Type these commands **inside Pi** (not in a shell). Begin with `/help` for Pi's
own commands; Trebol's commands below are provided by the extension pack in
this repository. Slash commands configure the session or open UI; for research,
edits, tasks, and memory retrieval, describe the work to the agent so it can
invoke the corresponding tools. Some panels require interactive `pi` rather
than headless `pi -p`.

### First task and memory

1. Describe your task normally, e.g. “Inspect the auth flow and plan a safe fix.”
   The agent's `bootstrap` tool selects relevant memory and up to two skills,
   then creates or reconciles tasks. Inspect its evidence before acting.
2. `/bootstrap status` reports strategy, model and readiness;
   `/bootstrap parallel|combined|off|reset` changes strategy and
   `/bootstrap model` opens a model selector. `/mem status|on|off` controls
   bootstrap enforcement. While enforcement is on, ordinary tool calls before
   bootstrap are blocked; `/mem off` is the recovery option if bootstrap fails.
   `Ctrl+D` toggles the session-only bootstrap requirement (shown in the footer).
3. `/tasks` opens the **read-only** task browser (interactive TUI). Ask the
   agent to use `TaskManage` for edits, dependencies and evidence-backed
   completion. `/memory-capture status|on|off` reports or changes session
   candidate extraction; `/memory-review` attempts review of one candidate
   with a single readable source reference. Other candidates may remain
   pending; an absent model or source evidence cannot establish a verified fact.
4. Ask the agent to `memory_history search` or `recall` with a task-specific
   query, or index a Markdown document with `context_index`, then use
   `context_outline` and `context_read` for cited sections. `/swarm-context`
   lists indexed sources and their staleness. To promote an **already verified**
   project record to global memory, use `/memory-promote repository ID`
   (or `worktree ID [namespace]`); this requires interactive confirmation and
   does nothing when declined. Never put secrets in memory.

```

### Start a project and configure your workspace

`/init a TypeScript CLI` starts a project interview in the current workspace;
`/init ./example a TypeScript CLI` selects a relative target directory. The
agent must call `project_init` to **inspect**, **plan** an exact file list, show
you that list and get approval before **apply**. Existing files are preserved;
an out-of-workspace target is rejected. The resulting structure policy blocks
unapproved paths. `/configure` opens a draft picker for prompt profiles,
context sources, skill/tool allowlists and workspace files; select **Apply**
to save or **Cancel** to discard. `/sp` selects/edits prompt profiles and
`/sp current` inspects the effective prompt. `/system` opens the prompt and
runtime inspector. `/skill` lists available skills; `/swarm-skills NAME` shows
one description (or lists skills if no matching name).

### Everyday commands

| Command | What to expect / important limit |
| --- | --- |
| `/btw Why did this test fail?` | Read-only side question using the current session as background. TUI and an active model are required; Escape aborts an active question or closes the overlay. |
| `/codemode` or `/codemode status|on|off|list` | Pick available tools, inspect mode or toggle CodeMode. `on` hides native tools while the bounded `codemode` tool remains available; `off` restores them. |
| `/supervisor status` or `/supervisor` | Inspect configuration/status (JSON in non-interactive mode) or open the TUI settings for optional Jev audit, operational review and memory worker. Workers need configured credentials/adapters; unavailable actions report an error rather than claiming completion. |
| `/vault list`, `/vault add [id]`, `/vault remove <id>` | List IDs/kinds, enter a global secret through UI prompts, or remove an entry. Add needs an interactive input UI; never paste credentials into chat or commit them. |
| `/hooks` or `/hooks GROUP on|off` | Inspect or change a known hook group; an unknown group reports an error. |
| `/goal CONDITION`, `/goal status|clear` | Persist a goal condition, inspect it, or clear it. An overlong condition is rejected. |
| `/loop [10m] TASK`, `/loop status|stop` | Schedule repeats in the current session; default interval is 10 minutes. Loops expire and are cancelled on shutdown/reload; use `scheduler` for delay/cron jobs. |
| `/trebol-update` or `/trebol-update install` | Check the release manifest or launch `pi update --extensions` and restart Pi afterward. Offline mode, manifest errors and launch failures are reported; this is not an in-place live reload. |
| `/swarm-autogen status|on|off|manual` | Show or change generated-skill mode; restart/reload to apply. |
| `/swarm-thinking` | Open Pi thinking-level selector (including off, low, medium, high); `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T` opens the same picker. |
| `/swarm-mcp` or `/swarm-mcp discover SERVER` | Inspect configured MCP servers or discover server tools; requires an enabled server/connection. |
| `/metrics`, `/control-panel`, `/swarm-tools` | Show current conversation counters, durable agent/job status, or registered tools. |
| `/annoyed list`, `/annoyed read ID`, `/annoyed on|off` | Inspect recorded defect reports or toggle the annoyance reminder. A missing issue ID reports an error. |
| `/paste-image` | Paste a Windows clipboard bitmap into Pi's editor; non-Windows platforms use Pi's native paste behavior. |

Other inspection controls include `/plan-mode` (current plan state),
`/cache` (request-change telemetry, **not** provider cache-hit counts), and
`/swarm-runtime` (runtime/MCP status). `/swarm-websearch discover` initializes
the optional web-search MCP server; if its configuration or connection is
unavailable, use the `swarm-websearch` tool status or inspect the server config
rather than assuming search is working. These integrations are optional.

Use `/paseo status` and `/paseo setup` to inspect remote access before changing
anything; the explicit mutating step is `/paseo setup apply` (details below).
These are Trebol commands; Pi itself may offer additional commands such as
`/settings` and `/help`.

## Paseo remote access

On Linux, the Paseo extension starts an already-built daemon independently of
the current Pi session. New daemons default to `127.0.0.1:6767`; an explicit
`PASEO_LISTEN` override is honored. State is shared per user under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/pi-swarm/paseo` (default `~/.local/state/pi-swarm/paseo`).

With Tailscale installed, logged in, and authorized to manage Serve, an explicit
`/paseo setup apply` discovers this machine's hostname, merges it into
`daemon.hostnames` in `$PASEO_HOME/config.json` (default `~/.paseo/config.json`),
hot-reloads Paseo, and configures a persistent **tailnet-only** HTTPS route.
No machine-specific hostname or manual JSON edit is needed for normal setup.
Ordinary Pi startup only starts/checks the daemon; it does not change config or
network exposure. Tool callers must explicitly supply `apply: true` to apply
setup; without it, `setup` and `serve` only inspect.
Existing unrelated config is preserved; conflicting Serve/Funnel routes are
reported rather than overwritten. Success requires HTTPS health and a WebSocket
hello/status/pong exchange, not merely an open port.

```text
/paseo status         # inspect the daemon
/paseo setup          # inspect without applying changes
/paseo setup apply    # retry automatic connection setup
```

For reboot-safe Linux startup, install the optional per-user systemd unit from
the repository root after Paseo has been built:

```bash
node tools/install/paseo-service.mjs install
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now paseo.service
systemctl --user status paseo.service
```

The unit waits for `network-online.target`, checks that Tailscale is available,
keeps the daemon supervised with bounded restart backoff, and uses the same
`PASEO_HOME`/`PASEO_LISTEN` values as the extension. User lingering must be
enabled for startup without an interactive login (`loginctl enable-linger
"$USER"`). Inspect failures with `journalctl --user -u paseo.service -b`.
The unit starts Paseo itself; run `/paseo setup apply` separately when the
tailnet-only Serve route needs to be created or repaired.

Tailscale login/permissions remain prerequisites. This integration is not a
boot-time supervisor or a complete cross-platform installer. Fresh global Pi
package clones do not contain a built Paseo submodule; provision the Paseo build
before expecting automatic startup. Interrupted setup locks fail closed and
require inspection before removal. A working same-host connection does not prove
mobile roaming, machine reboot, or long-duration network-drop resilience.
Update/build operations refuse while a daemon record is live; stop it explicitly
first. Failed stops retain their records for recovery. Linux config writes use
verified directory descriptors; unrelated Serve ports, hosts, and services cause
setup to refuse rather than risk replacing them.
Serve changes use Tailscale's local API with `ETag`/`If-Match`; a concurrent
change is rejected rather than overwritten. Linux defaults to
`/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock` (`TAILSCALE_SOCKET` can override it).
An unavailable API, missing ETag, or permission denial fails closed without
falling back to an unconditional Serve command.

## Contributing

Changes should preserve the Pi/Swarm boundary and keep extensions thin:

1. Put domain logic in the appropriate package or `.pi/lib/` module.
2. Put registration and Pi lifecycle wiring in `.pi/extensions/`.
3. Put authorization and execution constraints in the policy layer.
4. Put rendering in the UI or render bridge, never in semantic state.
5. Update `AGENTS.md` and architecture notes when repository boundaries change.
6. Run the narrowest useful tests, then the broader validation relevant to the
   change.

Please include a clear description of the behavior changed, the commands run,
and any known validation gaps in pull requests.
