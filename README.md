# Trebol v2.0

Trebol v2.0 is Clover's internal harness and the successor to the original
Swarm Go agent harness. It brings the Swarm development model
to Pi as an extension pack: structured prompt and
context assembly, policy and hooks, durable state, tasks, subagents, skills,
research tools, parity checks, and a Swarm-oriented terminal experience.

> **Status:** Active development. The repository is evolving quickly and some
> interfaces are still experimental.

## Why this repository exists

We spent a long time building and using these capabilities in the Swarm SDK.
That work gave us a mature set of ideas—agents, tools, skills, hooks, policy,
tasks, memory, and verification—but it also meant maintaining a separate agent
runtime and user experience.

We decided to move the integration to **Pi**. Pi already provides the provider
and agent loop, session management, native tools, and terminal UI. Trebol now
adds the Swarm capabilities as extensions instead of maintaining a second agent
runtime. This keeps the boundary clear:

```text
Pi owns the agent loop, provider, sessions, native tools, and TUI
        ↓
Trebol extensions add Swarm context, policy, tools, state, and UI
```

The migration is not a rewrite of the Swarm model. It is an adaptation of that
model to Pi's lifecycle and extension APIs, with parity fixtures and probes to
make behavioral differences visible.

## Capabilities

### Runtime and context

- Swarm system-prompt and context assembly with provenance and bounded inputs
- Hierarchical `AGENTS.md` discovery
- Plan mode, thinking controls, prompt-context configuration, and inspection
- Session startup and rehydration through Pi lifecycle events
- Runtime hooks, transport parity, cache telemetry, and update checks

### Tools and orchestration

- Bash, filesystem, patch, image-reading, search, and research tools
- Subagents through `Agent` and `AgentControl`
- Task creation, planning, blocking, notes, status, and run control
- Schedules, goals, loops, and wakeups
- MCP and vault adapters
- CodeMode for confined, composable tool workflows
- User questions and structured annoyance/defect reporting

### State and memory

- Durable session entries and conversation metadata
- Repository, worktree, and global memory scopes
- Bounded history search and retrieval with redaction
- Shared state that does not depend on what the TUI happens to render

### Policy and presentation

- Capability, workspace, mutation, network, and approval policy
- Disk hooks and policy nudges
- Pi-native tool renderers plus Swarm hook rows and widgets
- Conversation metrics, footer segments, themes, control-panel status, and
  the `/btw` side-question overlay

### Verification

- Pi ↔ Swarm behavioral parity probes and fixtures
- Unit tests, integration tests, build checks, and dogfood commands
- Architecture notes documenting the migration and the important seams

## How it works

Pi loads extensions from `.pi/extensions/` one level deep. The numeric layer
prefixes define load order:

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `00-runtime` | Integration boundary, hooks, runtime, transport, telemetry |
| `10-context` | Prompt assembly, context, plan mode, skills, thinking |
| `20-policy` | Disk hooks and policy nudges |
| `30-tools` | Agents, tasks, bash, filesystem, search, MCP, research, vault, and more |
| `40-state` | Memory history and conversation metadata |
| `50-ui` | Metrics, themes, status, control panel, and UI extensions |

Each layer has a `package.json` whose `pi.extensions` list is authoritative.
An extension registers with Pi using `registerTool`, `registerCommand`,
`registerShortcut`, or lifecycle handlers such as `session_start`,
`before_agent_start`, `tool_call`, and `tool_result`.

The implementation is split between thin Pi adapters and reusable packages:

```text
.pi/extensions/       Pi entrypoints and registration
.pi/lib/              Shared runtime, context, tool, state, and UI helpers
packages/             Reusable TypeScript packages grouped by capability
docs/architecture/    Living design and migration notes
docs/parity/          Parity plan, acceptance criteria, and media
tests/                Repository-level tests
tools/                Probes, integration runners, install checks, and maintenance
vendor/               Read-only upstream references and submodules
```

Semantic state, authorization, persistence, and cancellation belong to the
runtime or state layers—not to rendered transcript text. UI code presents
state; it must not become the source of truth for that state.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.pi/extensions/` | Pi extension entrypoints, grouped by load layer |
| `.pi/lib/` | Shared implementation used by extensions |
| `.pi/test/` | Tests for Pi-specific code |
| `.pi/config/` | Project prompt and Swarm settings; credentials stay ignored |
| `.pi/themes/` | Local Pi themes |
| `packages/runtime/` | Core identity, contracts, runtime control, and bootstrap |
| `packages/context/` | Prompt assets, skills, and generated-skill lifecycle |
| `packages/policy/` | Capability and execution policy |
| `packages/tools/` | Agents, CodeMode, MCP, scheduling, and task management |
| `docs/` | Architecture, plans, references, and parity documentation |
| `artifacts/` | Ignored probe output, recordings, and baselines |
| `vendor/` | Read-only upstream source and reference submodules |

The repository operating contract is [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Read it before
making changes; it describes extension inventory, capability ownership, safety
rules, and validation expectations.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js with npm workspaces support
- Git, including submodule support when working with vendored references
- Pi installed and available on your `PATH` for interactive use

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the runtime packages:

```bash
npm run build:runtime
```

Build all packages:

```bash
npm run build
```

Pi discovers the project extensions from the repository's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pi": {
    "extensions": [
      ".pi/extensions/00-runtime",
      ".pi/extensions/10-context",
      ".pi/extensions/20-policy",
      ".pi/extensions/30-tools",
      ".pi/extensions/40-state",
      ".pi/extensions/50-ui"
    ],
    "themes": [".pi/themes"]
  }
}
```

Start Pi from the repository root so the project extensions and hierarchical
context files are discovered:

```bash
pi
```

## Paseo remote access

On Linux, the Paseo extension starts an already-built daemon independently of
the current Pi session. New daemons default to `127.0.0.1:6767`; an explicit
`PASEO_LISTEN` override is honored. State is shared per user under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/pi-swarm/paseo` (default `~/.local/state/pi-swarm/paseo`).

With Tailscale installed, logged in, and authorized to manage Serve, an explicit
`/paseo setup apply` discovers this machine's hostname, merges it into
`daemon.hostnames` in `$PASEO_HOME/config.json` (default `~/.paseo/config.json`),
hot-reloads Paseo, and configures a persistent **tailnet-only** HTTPS route.
No machine-specific hostname or manual JSON edit is needed for normal setup.
Ordinary Pi startup only starts/checks the daemon; it does not change config or
network exposure. Tool callers must explicitly supply `apply: true` to apply
setup; without it, `setup` and `serve` only inspect.
Existing unrelated config is preserved; conflicting Serve/Funnel routes are
reported rather than overwritten. Success requires HTTPS health and a WebSocket
hello/status/pong exchange, not merely an open port.

```text
/paseo status         # inspect the daemon
/paseo setup          # inspect without applying changes
/paseo setup apply    # retry automatic connection setup

```

For reboot-safe Linux startup, install the optional per-user systemd unit from
the repository root after Paseo has been built:

```bash
node tools/install/paseo-service.mjs install
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now paseo.service
systemctl --user status paseo.service
```

The unit waits for `network-online.target`, checks that Tailscale is available,
keeps the daemon supervised with bounded restart backoff, and uses the same
`PASEO_HOME`/`PASEO_LISTEN` values as the extension. User lingering must be
enabled for startup without an interactive login (`loginctl enable-linger
"$USER"`). Inspect failures with `journalctl --user -u paseo.service -b`.
The unit starts Paseo itself; run `/paseo setup apply` separately when the
tailnet-only Serve route needs to be created or repaired.

Tailscale login/permissions remain prerequisites. This integration is not a
boot-time supervisor or a complete cross-platform installer. Fresh global Pi
package clones do not contain a built Paseo submodule; provision the Paseo build
before expecting automatic startup. Interrupted setup locks fail closed and
require inspection before removal. A working same-host connection does not prove
mobile roaming, machine reboot, or long-duration network-drop resilience.
Update/build operations refuse while a daemon record is live; stop it explicitly
first. Failed stops retain their records for recovery. Linux config writes use
verified directory descriptors; unrelated Serve ports, hosts, and services cause
setup to refuse rather than risk replacing them.
Serve changes use Tailscale's local API with `ETag`/`If-Match`; a concurrent
change is rejected rather than overwritten. Linux defaults to
`/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock` (`TAILSCALE_SOCKET` can override it).
An unavailable API, missing ETag, or permission denial fails closed without
falling back to an unconditional Serve command.

## Development and validation

## Contributing

Changes should preserve the Pi/Swarm boundary and keep extensions thin:

1. Put domain logic in the appropriate package or `.pi/lib/` module.
2. Put registration and Pi lifecycle wiring in `.pi/extensions/`.
3. Put authorization and execution constraints in the policy layer.
4. Put rendering in the UI or render bridge, never in semantic state.
5. Update `AGENTS.md` and architecture notes when repository boundaries change.
6. Run the narrowest useful tests, then the broader validation relevant to the
   change.

Please include a clear description of the behavior changed, the commands run,
and any known validation gaps in pull requests.
